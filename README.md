# Wave Furniture - ReactJS

A modern, responsive furniture storefront built first with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, then refactored to **React** with reusable components and simple state management. Includes product listing, filters, cart, and a lightweight checkout preview.

**Live demo (static):** [View Demo](https://shashank-modi.github.io/Web-Programming-Mini-Project/)  
**React refactor:** can run locally
